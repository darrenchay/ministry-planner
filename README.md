# Notes for developers
- npm insall after cloning and each time changing branches
- Create a branch when starting a new part of development
- DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN DIRECTLY 
- When assigned a pull request, review the code to see if everything is ok then approve or add comments 
- Generally, the one who did the development on that branch will be the one merging 

## useful console git commands
- git branch 'branchName' -> changes the branch you are working on and goes to branch 'branchName'
- git checkout -b 'newbranchName' -> creates a new local branch and names this branch 'newBranchName'
